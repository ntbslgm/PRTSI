## Requirmenets:
- Python3
- Pytorch==1.7
- Numpy==1.20.1
- scikit-learn==0.24.1

## Datasets

### Available Datasets
We used four public datasets in this study. We also provide the **preprocessed** versions as follows:
- [SSC](https://researchdata.ntu.edu.sg/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.21979/N9/UD1IM9)
- [UCIHAR](https://researchdata.ntu.edu.sg/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.21979/N9/0SYHTZ)
- [MFD](https://researchdata.ntu.edu.sg/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.21979/N9/PU85XN)





## Training procedure

The experiments are organised in a hierarchical way such that:
- Several experiments are collected under one directory assigned by `--experiment_description`.
- Each experiment could have different trials, each is specified by `--run_description`.

### Training a model

To train a model:

```
python trainers/train.py  --experiment_description exp1  \
                --run_description run_1 \
                --da_method MAPU \
                --dataset HAR \
                --backbone CNN \
                --num_runs 3 \
```
### Launching a sweep
Sweeps here are deployed on [Wandb](https://wandb.ai/), which makes it easier for visualization, following the training progress, organizing sweeps, and collecting results.

```
python trainers/sweep.py  --experiment_description exp1_sweep  \
                --run_description sweep_over_lr \
                --da_method MAPU \
                --dataset HAR \
                --backbone CNN \
                --num_runs 3\
                --num_sweeps 50 \
                --sweep_project_wandb MAPU_HAR
```
Upon the run, you will find the running progress in the specified project page in wandb.




## Results
- Each run will have all the cross-domain scenarios results in the format `src_to_trg_run_x`, where `x`
is the run_id (you can have multiple runs by assigning `--num_runs` arg). 
- Under each directory, you will find the classification report, a log file, checkpoint, 
and the different risks scores.
- By the end of the all the runs, you will find the overall average and std results in the run directory.
